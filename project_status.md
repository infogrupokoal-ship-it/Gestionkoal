# Project Status Checkpoint

**Date:** viernes, 12 de septiembre de 2025

**Current Project Directory:** `C:\proyecto\gestion_avisos`
**Older Project Directory (for reference):** `C:\Users\info\OneDrive\Escritorio\gestion_avisos`

---

## Summary of Current State:

The application is a Flask-based "Notice Management" (Gesti√≥n de Avisos) system. We are currently in the process of debugging and getting the application to run locally.

## Errors Encountered and Fixes Applied:

1.  **`sqlite3.OperationalError: near "%"` syntax error` in `init_db_command` function:**
    *   **Problem:** The `_execute_sql` helper function was not being passed the `is_sqlite` parameter correctly, causing it to use `%s` placeholders for SQLite queries.
    *   **Fix:** Modified `app.py` to pass `is_sqlite=is_sqlite` to all `_execute_sql` calls within the `init_db_command` function.

2.  **`NameError: name 'cursor' is not defined` in `init_db_command` function:**
    *   **Problem:** The `cursor` object was not defined in the correct scope after re-opening the database connection in `init_db_command`.
    *   **Fix:** Added `cursor = db.cursor()` after re-opening the connection in `init_db_command` in `app.py`.

3.  **`sqlite3.OperationalError: near "%"` syntax error` in `login` function:**
    *   **Problem:** The `login` function was directly using `cursor.execute` with `%s` placeholders instead of using the `_execute_sql` helper.
    *   **Fix:** Modified `app.py` to use `_execute_sql` in the `login` function.

4.  **`sqlite3.OperationalError: near "%"` syntax error` in `load_user` function:**
    *   **Problem:** Similar to the `login` function, `load_user` was directly using `cursor.execute` with `%s` placeholders.
    *   **Fix:** Modified `app.py` to use `_execute_sql` in the `load_user` function.

5.  **`'sqlite3.Cursor' object does not support the context manager protocol` in `_load_permissions` function:**
    *   **Problem:** The `_load_permissions` function was using `with conn.cursor() as cursor:`, which is not supported by `sqlite3.Cursor`.
    *   **Fix:** Changed `with conn.cursor() as cursor:` to `cursor = conn.cursor()` and ensured the cursor is closed in the `finally` block in `app.py`.

6.  **`werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'list_materials'`:**
    *   **Problem:** `templates/base.html` was linking to `list_materials`, but the corresponding route was missing in `app.py`.
    *   **Fix:** Added a new `@app.route("/materials")` function (`list_materials`) to `app.py` that renders `materials/list.html`.

7.  **`werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'add_trabajo'`:**
    *   **Problem:** `templates/base.html` was linking to `add_trabajo`, but the corresponding route was missing in `app.py`.
    *   **Fix:** Added a new `@app.route("/trabajos/add")` function (`add_trabajo`) to `app.py` that handles adding new jobs and renders `trabajos/form.html`.

8.  **`werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'list_clients'`:**
    *   **Problem:** `templates/base.html` was linking to `list_clients`, but the corresponding route was missing in `app.py`.
    *   **Fix:** Added a new `@app.route("/clients")` function (`list_clients`) to `app.py` that renders `clients/list.html`.

9.  **`werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'list_services'`:**
    *   **Problem:** `templates/base.html` was linking to `list_services`, but the corresponding route was missing in `app.py`.
    *   **Fix:** Added a new `@app.route("/services")` function (`list_services`) to `app.py` that renders `services/list.html`.

## Next Steps:

The current error is `werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'list_proveedores'`. I will address this next.

- Service Catalog (CRUD)
- Inventory Management (CRUD & Movements)
- Interactive Dashboard with FullCalendar integration

- Activity Logging (Audit Trail)
- Enhanced Inventory Module (Unit of Measure, Autocomplete)
- Freelancer/Collaborator Management

## Recent Error Log:

### 1. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'`
- **Cause:** The `psycopg2` library, required for PostgreSQL database connectivity, was not installed in the environment.
- **Attempted Fix:** Added `psycopg2-binary` to `requirements.txt` and attempted `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### 2. `ERROR: Failed building wheel for psycopg2-binary` / `error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required.`
- **Cause:** Installation of `psycopg2-binary` failed due to a missing system dependency (Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools) on the user's Windows machine.
- **Attempted Fix:** Switched from `psycopg2-binary` to `psycopg2` in `requirements.txt` (also failed with the same error). Decided to proceed with SQLite only for now and commented out `psycopg2` related imports and code in `app.py`.

### 3. `NameError: name '_execute_sql' is not defined`
- **Cause:** The `_execute_sql` helper function was defined locally within `init_db_command` but was being called from `setup_new_database` (a separate function), making it inaccessible.
- **Attempted Fix:** Moved the `_execute_sql` function to the global scope in `app.py`.

### 4. `IndentationError: unexpected indent`
- **Cause:** Incorrect indentation in `app.py` after moving the `_execute_sql` function.
- **Attempted Fix:** Corrected the indentation in `app.py` around the affected lines.

### 5. `NameError: name 'is_sqlite' is not defined`
- **Cause:** The `_execute_sql` function, after being moved to the global scope, lost access to the `is_sqlite` variable, which was previously available in the local scope of `init_db_command`.
- **Attempted Fix:** This is the current issue. The plan is to modify `_execute_sql` to accept `is_sqlite` as an argument and pass it in all calls. Also, remove redundant `_execute_sql` definitions within `import_csv_data_command`.

---
**Current Task:** Addressing `NameError: name 'is_sqlite' is not defined` and cleaning up `_execute_sql` definitions.

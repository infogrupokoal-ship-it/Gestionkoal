# Project Checkpoint: Grupo Koal Service Management App

This document summarizes the current state of the "Grupo Koal Service Management App" development as of this checkpoint.

## Current Status:
- Attempting to fix the `NameError: name '_execute_sql' is not defined` error.
- The `_execute_sql` function was moved to global scope, but redundant definitions still exist within `import_csv_data_command`.
- `psycopg2` usage has been commented out in `app.py` and removed from `requirements.txt` to allow the application to run with SQLite only.
- Example data has been added to `init_db_command` for clients, providers, materials, services, jobs, and tasks.
- "Fill Example" buttons have been added to `clients/form.html`, `proveedores/form.html`, `materials/form.html`, and `services/form.html`.
- Attempting to add "Fill Example" button to `trabajos/form.html` is currently failing due to `replace` command issues (multiple `{% endblock %}` tags).

## Next Steps:
1.  **Fix `NameError`:** Remove all redundant `_execute_sql` function definitions from `import_csv_data_command`.
2.  **Update `_execute_sql` signature:** Modify the global `_execute_sql` function to accept `is_sqlite` as an argument.
3.  **Update `_execute_sql` calls:** Ensure all calls to `_execute_sql` (both in `init_db_command` and `import_csv_data_command`) pass the `is_sqlite` flag.
4.  **Complete "Fill Example" buttons:** Successfully add the "Fill Example" button and JavaScript logic to `trabajos/form.html` and `tareas/form.html`.
5.  **Verify application:** Run `python -m flask run` to ensure the application starts without errors and all changes are functional.
6.  **Review and Refactor:** Once the application is running, review the code for any further improvements or refactoring opportunities.
